Here the user needs to put the pickle files of the input data (X and y) for training the CNN-LSTM model.

The requried data include:
- The table file (e.g. csv format) of the sample data (including columns of the target soil property, e.g. soil organic carbon values);
- The pickle file of input data (X) for CNN (e.g., climate and topographic data with spatially contextual information);
- The pickle file of input data (X) for LSTM (e.g., EVI data with temporally dynamic information);
- The pickle file of input data (X) for LSTM (e.g., phenological data with temporally dynamic information).
